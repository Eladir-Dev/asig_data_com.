## About

The **asig_data_com** project was developed as part of a data communication class assignment. It centers around organizing structured data and performing queries or transformations using SQL. The project demonstrates how to design and interact with a small-scale database system that could be expanded or integrated into larger data systems.

---

## Technologies / Tools Used

* **SQL / SQL Plus** — Used for scripting, creating tables, inserting data, and querying.
* **VSCode** — Used as the primary editor for writing and debugging SQL scripts.
* **Notepad++** — Used for quick edits and viewing plain text data or CSVs.

---

## Project Description

This project includes:

* **Database schema design**: Tables and relationships modeled to represent meaningful data.
* **SQL scripts**: Used for creating tables, inserting sample data, and executing queries.
* **Basic reports/queries**: To extract useful information from the dataset.
* **Sample datasets**: (if included) demonstrating practical data use and testing.

Its focus is on clear relational modeling and clean data access patterns using SQL.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eladir-Dev/asig_data_com.git
   cd asig_data_com
   ```

2. **Open the SQL scripts** using your preferred editor (VSCode or Notepad++).

3. **Run the scripts** using SQL Plus or your database tool:

   ```sql
   @schema.sql
   @insert_data.sql
   @queries.sql
   ```

4. **Explore or extend** the queries to analyze or manipulate the data.

---

## Potential Improvements

* Add sample outputs or result snapshots of queries.
* Include CSV or JSON export scripts.
* Expand the dataset to handle more complex scenarios.
* Add comments and documentation to each query for clarity.
* Modularize scripts for reusability.
